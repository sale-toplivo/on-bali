Is Bali a safe destination to travel?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> Bali is fairly a safe tourist destination, even for solo female travellers. There is little violent crime in Bali. However, as a visitor, be careful while crossing the roads as motorbikers swarm the streets. Swimmers should be mindful as not all the beaches are safe because of riptides. Be cautious against pickpockets and scams. The threat of volcanoes, tsunamis and earthquakes are always there, but so far, Bali has not faced any outright devastation. It’s still business as usual in this tourist hotspot.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. For how many days should I book a Bali tour package?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> A Bali travel itinerary is usually of a week or six nights and seven days duration. If you are for the first time on holiday to Bali, you can cover almost all the highlights of this island during this period. Bali tour packages can also be customised as per your requirement.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. What is a good time to visit Bali?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> The dry season (summer) starting from May and ending in October is the best time to plan a Bali tour. Also a peak tourist season, the weather at this time is the best to explore Bali’s attractions and enjoy different tourist activities.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. Is there direct flight connectivity to Bali from India?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> At the time of writing, there are no airlines that fly nonstop to Bali from India. All flights to Bali have a stopover in Kuala Lumpur. Delhi and Chennai will be operating direct air connectivity to Bali/Denpasar via Air India flight soon in the upcoming months.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. What languages do they speak in Bali?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> The main languages spoken in Bali are Balinese, Indonesian and English. Tourists can go about in English at all major tourist places. But in remote parts of the island, locals might not speak and understand English, and an interpreter or translator would be required.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. How to pack for a Bali vacation?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> As Bali is a tropical island, you should bring light cotton clothes, sunglasses, sunscreen lotion, comfortable walking sandals if travelling between May to October during summer. For the rainy season between November to March, it will be useful to carry a raincoat/ umbrella and a waterproof jacket. Hindu temples are also part of most <span> Bali tour packages</span> , and on entering these religious sites, both men and women must wear a sarong. You can buy them once you are in Bali or even hire them near some of the more prominent temples. Usually, sarongs are included in the temple entrance fee.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. Is it safe to hike up Mount Batur?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> Mount Batur is still an active volcano, which last erupted in 2000, and it is strongly recommended that you go for the climb only with a certified local guide. That said, when it comes to mountain treks in Bali, Mount Batur is the most popular destination. First of all, the slopes are not steep and arduous, so even amateur trekkers can tackle them. Second, it only takes two and a half hours to reach the peak of Batur compared to seven or eight hours to reach the summit of Mt. Agung. Thirdly, the sunrise views from its vantage point are breathtaking.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. Does Bali holiday package include entrance fee to the monuments?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> Yes, like most tour packages, <span> Bali holiday packages</span>  include entrance fee to monuments such as temples, etc. If the monument entry does not read in the inclusions of your travel itinerary, then you will have to bear the cost on your own.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. What is the best time to surf in Bali?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> Surfing in Bali can be done all year round. However, May until September is the best surfing time when the tide, wind and swell together create surfing paradise, particularly on the western coast of the island. The eastern coast of Bali is suitable for surfing between November and March when the reef breaks are better for more experienced surfers.</span> </span> </span> <br/> <br/> <span> <span> Q. What has Bali on offer for kids?</span> <br/> <span> <span> <span> A.</span> There are a lot of fun and engaging activities for kids travelling to Bali. Some of the popular attractions in Bali for young travellers are Bali Safari and Marine Park, Kemmenuh Butterfly Park, dolphin watching in Lovina, sea walking, slides and water-based activities at Waterbom Bali among others.</span> </span> </span> </p> <h4> Top International Flight Routes </h4> Delhi to Dubai Flights Mumbai to Dubai Flights Delhi to Toronto Flights Delhi to Singapore Flights Ahmedabad to Dubai Flights Delhi to Kathmandu Flights Bengaluru to Dubai Flights Mumbai to Bangkok Flights Mumbai to Toronto Flights Chennai to Colombo Flights <h4> Bali Holiday Packages By Theme <span> X</span> </h4> Bali Beach packages Bali Honeymoon packages Bali Sightseeing packages Bali Exotic packages Bali Fly and Stay packages Bali Romantic packages Bali Family packages Bali Water Sports packages Bali Affordable packages Bali Shopping packages Bali Bestseller packages More <i> </i> Less <i> </i> <h4> Holiday Themes </h4> Honeymoon Holiday Packages Beach Holiday Packages Family Holiday Packages Summer Holiday Packages Winter Holiday Packages Luxury Holiday Packages Affordable Holiday Packages Exotic Holiday Packages Bestseller Holiday Packages Adventure Holiday Packages View More <h4> Explore Things To Do in Bali</h4> Your gateway to the best activities Explore Now <h3> Bali Travel Guide</h3> bali Overview Best time to visit bali Places to visit bali How to reach bali Transport in bali People of bali Languages of bali History of bali Culture of bali Weather of bali Map of bali View More <i> </i> bali Flights Chennai to Denpasar Bali Cochin to Denpasar Bali Hyderabad to Denpasar Bali Bengaluru to Denpasar Bali Thiruvananthapuram to Denpasar Bali View More <h3> International Flights To indonesia</h3> Flights To Denpasar Bali Flights To Jakarta View More <h3> International Tour Links</h3> International Tour Packages International Tourism International Honeymoon Packages Holiday Deals <h3> Popular International Tour Packages</h3> Europe Tour Packages Dubai Tour Packages Thailand Tour Packages Maldives Tour Packages Singapore Tour Packages Malaysia Tour Packages Mauritius Tour Packages Russia Tour Packages New Zealand Tour Packages South Africa Tour Packages View More <h4> Top International Airlines</h4> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Lufthansa</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Thai Airways</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Air India Express Airlines</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Singapore Airlines</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Cathay Pacific </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Air France</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Turkish Airlines</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Emirates</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> British Airways</span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Malaysia Airlines</span> Our Family <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> Company Information More About Us | Leadership Team | Our Products | Awards Won | Customer Testimonials | Press Releases Investor Relations Company Overview | Quarterly Earnings | Press Releases | Reports &amp; Presentations | SEC Filings | Corporate Governance | Social Media Disclosure | Investor FAQs Partner With yatra Travel Agent Sign Up | Become a Cab Vendor | Register Your Hotel | Register Your Homestay | Sell Holiday Packages | Sell Your Activities | List Your Bus Inventory | Advertise With Us Customer Care Support &amp; FAQs | Terms &amp; Conditions | Privacy Policy | User Agreement Product Offerings Flights | Airlines | Domestic Airlines | Domestic Flights | International Airlines | SriLankan Airlines | Emirates Airlines | Saudi Airlines | Nepal Airlines | Singapore Airlines | Malaysia Airlines | Indigo Flights | Air India Airlines | Go Air Airlines | Spicejet Flights | Airasia Flights | International Flights | Flight Schedule | Airline Flight status | Cheap Air tickets | Web Checkin | Hotels | Domestic Hotels (In India) | Homestays | Yatra for Business | Yatra for SMEs | India Tourism | International Tourism | Holidays | Domestic Holiday Packages | International Holiday Packages | Trade Fairs 2020 | Activities | Domestic Activities | International Activities | Bus booking | Bus Ticket | Trains | IRCTC | Indian Railways | Check Train PNR Status | Monuments of India | Taj Mahal | Qutub Minar | Red Fort | Yatra Android Mobile App | Yatra iOS Mobile App | Gift Vouchers | Careers | Blog | VISA Information More Retail Offices | Sitemap | Visa Information | Bug Bounty | KSRTC | HRTC | GSRTC | TNSTC | RSRTC | Manali | Darjeeling | Resorts Near Me | Oyo Rooms Near Me | Interpack 2020 | Drupa 2020 | Yatra For Corporates | Yatra On Mobiles <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> <i> </i> </span> <span> Connect with us :</span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <p> Copyright &copy; 2020 Yatra Online Private Limited, India.
