It’s one of 17,500 islands in the Indonesian archipelago, yet even among its colorful neighbors—and even after decades of tourism development—it stands alone in its incomparable beauty. It is part of the Coral Triangle, which has the highest diversity of marine species on earth, making the coral reefs that surround the island a spectacular sight. Despite the island’s small size, its population holds most of Indonesia’s Hindu minority. Bali is known for surfing, ancient temples, and palaces, but also has active volcanoes and wild jungles. It has white-sand beaches in the south, and striking black sand in the north and west.</p> <p> Bali has been a popular tourist destination for travelers from all over the world, but especially Australians and Americans, for the past few decades. As a result, the island is well accustomed to meeting the needs of international tourists. Travel + Leisure ’s Bali travel guide will help you make the perfect trip to see Bali’s ancient and natural wonders.</p> </p> <span> Read Less</span> <h2> Visit Bali</h2> <span> </span> Trip Ideas <span> Budget Travel</span> Bali <span> A Budget-Friendly Trip to Bali?

The high season, which is Easter week and Chinese New Year, generally has higher hotel rates. The best time to find deals for Bali travel is between September and December, and the best time to visit is during the dry season, April through October.</p> <i> </i> <h3> Transportation</h3> <p> Public transportation in Bali is hard to come by, but it is possible to travel by taxi or to rent a motorbike.</p> <i> </i> <h3> Weather</h3> <p> Bali is situated near the equator and benefits from a tropical climate, with an average year-round temperature of 86°F (30°C).</p> <i> </i> <h3> Know Before You Go</h3> <p> One of the most picturesque things to do in Bali is a sunrise trek to the summit of Mount Batur .
